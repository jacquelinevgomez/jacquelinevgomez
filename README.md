# Hi, I’m Jacqueline! 👋

Math nerd | Data & Automation Enthusiast | Problem Solver

I thrive on **turning complex data into actionable insights** and making workflows easier for teams. I love **projects from start to finish**, from analyzing raw data to building automated pipelines that produce clean, usable reports.

I enjoy **making technical tasks simple for non-technical users**, and I have a perfectionist streak that ensures everything I produce is accurate and high-quality.
